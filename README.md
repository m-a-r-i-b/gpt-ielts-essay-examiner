## Gpt-IELTS-Essay-Examiner

IELTs essay scoring and feedback with GPT.
The project divides the scoring and feedback task into 4 sub tasks i.e.
-   Task Achievement
-   Coherence and Cohesion
-   Lexical Resources
-   Grammatical Range and Accuracy

It uses a separate prompt for each of the above tasks, specifically engineered to assess the respective criteria. Finally, outputing the combined result as an overall feedback and score.  


### Sample result can be found at

### Future Work / TODO :
-   Improve feedback and score separation logic
-   Handle edge cases
-   Add few-shot examples to better guide the system, if official corpus becomes available BINGO. Current corpus is not good enough
